# How to use git

## In the terminal
You can open a new terminal in VS Code by using `Ctrl + Shift + ~`

- `git status` View the status of any changes made to the code
- `git add <filename>` Stage a file to be committed *(`git add .` adds all the modified files)*
- `git commit -m "<commit message>"` Commit the staged files to be pushed to remote
- `git push` To push the code to a remote repository *(`git push -u origin <name of the branch>` to push the code to a specific branch)*





## VS Code Source Control
You can also directly commit code in VS Code. You can view the status of any changed files in the Source Control panel
